# WovenScript
## A *very* high level programming language

**WovenScript** is a simple, made for non-programmers programming language, which is designed to encourage people to try programming, and learn a real language like python or C++.  

Its also to show people how easy it is to make a language. If you know python, I *HIGHLY* suggest you try to edit **WovenScript** to make it more personalized.

To install, go to the releases tab and open the zip file of the latest release (Or the preferred one you want to use), then run `python3 where/file/is/main.py` (if you dont have python3, install it)
