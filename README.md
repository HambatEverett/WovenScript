# WovenScript
## A *very* high level programming language

**WovenScript** is a simple, made for non-programmers programming language, which is designed to encourage people to try programming, and learn a real language like python or C++.  

Its also to show people how easy it is to make a language. If you know python, I *HIGHLY* suggest you try to edit **WovenScript** to make it more personalized.

To install, go to the releases tab and open the zip file of the latest release (Or the preferred one you want to use), then run `python3 main.py` in your terminal. Youll have to find the directory it is inside with your file manager (e.g. finder or file explorer) and use `cd` to navigate to it: `cd ~/Downloads/`

if you dont have python3, install it at [their website](https://www.python.org/downloads/))  

Lang Lingo List:
 **Knit**: the file type that holds your code.
 **Weave**: Built-in functions of WovenScript.
